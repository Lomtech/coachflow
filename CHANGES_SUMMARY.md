## ⚡ Fix the 404 Error (Required!)

After pushing the code, you **must add environment variables in Netlify**:

### Step 1: Go to Netlify Dashboard
https://app.netlify.com/

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables
1. Select your CoachFlow site
2. Go to: **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
3. Add these required variables:

```
SUPABASE_URL         = https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY    = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Where to find these:**
- Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API
- Copy "Project URL" and "anon public" key

### Step 3: Trigger Deploy
1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**
3. Wait ~60 seconds

### Step 4: ✅ Done!
Your site should now be live without 404 errors!

**See [QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md](./QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.**

## 🔍 What Changed in build.js

### Before (Lines 125-129)
```javascript
// Füge Version zu styles.css hinzu
indexHtml = indexHtml.replace(
  /<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles\.css">/g,
  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=${buildVersion}">`
);
```

**Problem:** Didn't match self-closing tags like `<link ... />`

### After (Lines 125-129)
```javascript
// Füge Version zu styles.css hinzu (unterstützt selbst-schließende Tags)
indexHtml = indexHtml.replace(
  /<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles\.css"\s*\/?>/g,
  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=${buildVersion}" />`
);
```

**Fixed:** Now matches both `<link ... >` and `<link ... />` ✅

---

## 📊 Testing Results

### ✅ Build Test (With Environment Variables)
```bash
$ export SUPABASE_URL="https://example.supabase.co"
$ export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="eyJhbGci..."
$ node build.js
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Build erfolgreich abgeschlossen!
✅ 10 files created in dist/
✅ All credentials injected
✅ Cache-busting applied
```

### ❌ Build Test (Without Environment Variables)
```bash
$ node build.js
```

**Result:**
```
❌ FEHLER: Supabase Environment Variables fehlen!
```

**This is what was happening on Netlify!**

### ✅ Files Created in dist/
```
_redirects           ✅
agb.html             ✅
app.js               ✅ (with injected credentials)
