## üéØ How Routing Works

### URL Structure

| URL | What Shows | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| `https://coachflow1.netlify.app/` | **Platform landing page** | Main CoachFlow SaaS platform |
| `https://coachflow1.netlify.app/?coach=fitticoach` | **FittiCoach's site** | Individual coach's membership site |
| `https://coachflow1.netlify.app/?coach=john-smith` | **John Smith's site** | Another coach's site |
| `https://coachflow1.netlify.app/coach-register.html` | **Coach registration** | Where coaches sign up |
| `https://coachflow1.netlify.app/coach-login.html` | **Coach login** | Where coaches log in |
| `https://coachflow1.netlify.app/coach-dashboard.html` | **Coach dashboard** | Coach's admin panel |

### Routing Logic

```
1. User visits any URL
   ‚Üì
2. platform-router.js runs
   ‚Üì
3. Check: Is it a coach admin page?
   YES ‚Üí Skip routing, show page normally
   NO ‚Üí Continue
   ‚Üì
4. Check: URL has ?coach=slug parameter?
   YES ‚Üí Load coach site template + inject coach data
   NO ‚Üí Show platform landing page
```

### Dynamic Coach Sites

When a user visits `/?coach=SLUG`:

1. **Fetch Coach Data** from Supabase:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM coaches WHERE slug = 'SLUG' AND is_active = true
   ```

2. **Fetch Coach's Packages**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM packages WHERE coach_id = coach.id AND is_active = true
   ```

3. **Load Template**:
   - Fetch `coach-site-template.html`
   - Replace page content dynamically

4. **Inject Coach Data**:
   - Business name in header
   - Description in hero
   - Packages as pricing cards
   - Coach-specific branding

5. **Load Scripts**:
   - `app.js` for functionality
   - `app-dynamic-coach.js` for dynamic loading

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Platform page not showing

**Check:**
1. Is `/` URL correct?
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify `platform-router.js` is loaded

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// You should see:
[PLATFORM ROUTER] Initializing platform router...
[PLATFORM ROUTER] No coach parameter - showing platform landing page
```

### Issue: Coach site not loading

**Check:**
1. Does coach exist in database?
2. Is coach active? (`is_active = true`)
3. Is slug correct?

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Browser console should show:
[PLATFORM ROUTER] Loading coach site for: SLUG
[PLATFORM ROUTER] Coach data loaded: {...}
```

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check if coach exists
SELECT * FROM coaches WHERE slug = 'your-slug';

-- Activate coach if needed
UPDATE coaches SET is_active = true WHERE slug = 'your-slug';
```

### Issue: Packages not showing

**Check:**
1. Does coach have packages?
2. Are packages active?

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check packages
SELECT * FROM packages WHERE coach_id = 'coach-uuid';

-- Activate packages
UPDATE packages SET is_active = true WHERE coach_id = 'coach-uuid';
```
